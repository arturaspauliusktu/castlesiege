Detailed siege tower model. May use in any game. Should be the best model you can get free. I love sharing, thats all:) If you use it in your projects please let me know how you do it!

Textures are ok for C4D format but baked textures are perfectly fit to all other formats.
Just find and define them to the correct objects.

See you...
